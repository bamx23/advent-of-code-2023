# Advent of Code 2023 by @bamx23

This is how I've been solving the puzzles in the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
The solutions might not be perfect in terms of efficency, data structures or algorithms used or in terms of code style, but this all was for fun and for the challenge first!
